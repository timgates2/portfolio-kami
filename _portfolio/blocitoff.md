## Explanation

Blocitoff is a Self-Destructing to-do-list application. To do lists are fantastic to have but they have some shortcommings. The most prominent being, "How is the list managed?".

## Problem

Keeping your to-do-list managed manually is time-consuming and can lead to confusion. 

## Solution

Blocitoff provides a simple solution for this problem. It keeps your to-do list up to date by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed within a given frame of time. This app uses one week intervals. The thinking behind this working to-do-list is simple, if you haven't completed a task within a week, it's probably best to reschedule it. 

## Conclusion

Blocitoff is fully featured. Users can create accounts and start building their to-do-lists right-away. Creating this project was challenging but it tought me a lot about the power of time-management. It also showed me just how useful and flexible Ruby and Rails can be.
