## Explanation

Bloc Jams is the quentissential Bloc.io web app. I'd assume that most students who are Bloc.io Alumni have completed this project at least once. I have completed it twice. Once using vanilla JS and once using Angular.js. The application uses Buzz API for to play sound when a user clicks on the play buttons within the album view. The user can also click on player manipulation controls in the view near the bottom of the page. 

## Problem

The problem here is fairly straight-forward. A user would like to select an album/song and manipulate playback in a manor similar to that found in iTunes or Spotify.

## Results

The solution is a web application that enables the user to have the control they seek. This application must be presentable, legible and easy to use. When you take a look at this app you will appreciate the simplicity of it. The controls are easily located and the interface is what one would expect from a music playback application. .

## Conclusion

You can take a look at the application first hand here:
