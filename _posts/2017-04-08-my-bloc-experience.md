title: My Experience at Bloc.io
---
I started my training with Bloc.io in late 2015. I wanted to learn a new craft in order to begin a new career. I've found over the time I've spent with Bloc that I've learned more about myself than anything else. 

I've learned that in order to be a good student and a decent coder you must learn how to:

* Manage time well
* Stay on pace
* Retain the information

One of the most difficult portions of a Bootcamp training scenario is managing your time. Especially with an online bootcamp. Distractions are easily found and always available. I struggled with this aspect of it due to being a husband and father with very active family demands. I also had been doing odd jobs to make ends-meet during my time in the program.  

I found myself making excuses. Missing deadlines I'd set up for myself and not making the best use of my time. 

Luckily for me I had patient and diligent mentors who understood my situation and did their best to assist me. There wasn't much hand holding as opposed to just genuine encouragement. Also, my mentors served as examples. They were here, every appointment, on time and ready to help me get through this journey. It's been a hell of a ride and I wouldn't take it back for anything. I'm proud of the progress I've made with their help.

In these courses you are expected to show up with enough working knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. to go ahead and jump in and get to the higher level content. I was unprepared but caught up quick enough. 

I began with the backend portion of my Full-Stack course line-up. This included Ruby, Rails, MySQL and more. After the foundation portion was complete I moved on to creating a Project (Blocitoff) in Rails. 

Time for a break right? Nope, not the way Bloc rolls. Straight away it was time for Front-End course work. A refresher in HTML and CSS and straight into JavaScript. Soon after working through the foundation project in Javascript and NodeJS, I was on my way to refactoring the foundation project (BlocJams) in Angular. After that was complete it was time to refactor Blocitoff in Angular using Firebase as the backend. 

When you've completed either front-end or back-end you have to build a portfolio and spend some time evaulating yourself as you prepare for a new career. 

I highly recommend Bloc.io for those developers that need structure in approaching how they build their projects. It was a valuable journey and I'm glad I went through it.
