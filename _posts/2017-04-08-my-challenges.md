title: My Biggest Challenges
---

I think my biggest challenges are myself. Rather, challenges I have in place before even moving into a career as a developer. I have to challenge myself to remain hungry and eager to learn. That hunger has to be there daily for a Developer. It's not unlike becoming a Doctor. You NEVER stop learning and evolving. There is no room for developers who learn one skill and sit idle. That's not new for me but it will be the first time I've been in a career where it's the norm. 

Outside of that I don't have any big challenges. I've located myself in a tech focused region of the country. Career opportunities here are plentiful and diverse.
